I used the SVG library Snap only for animating the squeze of the sponge and the squeeze of the saliva gland. This library allows you to animate between two different svg paths. For the stomach animation I used p5.js to code the movement of the food and the scissors that follow it. ",

Part 1 of the functional prototype is a website that searches for keywords in headlines through the RSS feeds of over 20 english sources from around the world. It then visualizes how frequent related words appear with the search word. This visualization gives the user an idea of what is most being talked about in the news related to the topic. The user can click on the circle and it will display all the headlines in that group which are about the same topic. In Part 2, the user can click on a headline and replace words with synonyms from the thesaurus. In a comedic way, attention is brought to the fact that word choices change the meaning of a sentence, and can change our perception of the news event. I also created designs for users to filter sources from different parts of the world, which can yield interesting results revealing hegemonic differences in world views. Additionally I researched how sentence structure in headlines changes the meaning of the story, and designed a visualization in which users can rotate through and compare parts of speech in multiple headlines about the same topic.",
